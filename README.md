Original code from [Anca Lordache's tutorial.](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-compose-from-local-to-amazon-ecs/)

Then it follows [Espoir Murhabazi's tutorial](https://dev.to/espoir/how-to-use-the-aws-python-cdk-to-create-an-infrastructure-on-ecs-3lcc) to deploy the application.

```
npm install -g aws-cdk
